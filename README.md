# treechat
Stanford University's CS 193A Android Programming class (Spring 2019) Final Project

Implemented a multi-user chat system (akin to Slack) where users are able to create/join chat channels and send messages to each other. Uses Firebase backend for user authentication (Google Sign-In) and database storage.
